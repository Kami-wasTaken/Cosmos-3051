                <p id="dd">Currently, the most efficient way to produce energy is through nuclear fission. If research is successful we may use fusion reactors in the future which will cause an exponential increase in energy production.  
                </p>
                <p id="dd">But what is the next step for nuclear energy? It would be a Dyson sphere. The sun holds as much energy as trillions of nuclear bombs. If we can extract it, the galactic expansion would become viable and energy issues on Earth would cease to exist.
                </p>
                <p id="dd">A Dyson sphere is a device that would fully harness the energy of the sun. The best way to build it would be to surround the sun with quadrillion reflective satellites. But to build this many Satellites, we would have to resort to getting minerals from asteroids and other celestial bodies. We would most probably have to disassemble entire planets since the Earth won't have enough resources to even build 10% of it.
                </p>
                <p id="dd">Another complication would be, energy. If we utilize all of the energy on Earth, the most we could do is launch an entire mountain into space. To build a Dyson Sphere, we would have to set up a base on mercury as it is material rich and closest to the sun. Since the gravity there is about a 3rd of the Earth's launching satellites will also be easier. By setting up solar collectors we would be able to harness the energy to build a Dyson Sphere.
                </p>
                <p id="dd">This can only be possible if the entire earth becomes united and political conflicts are eradicated. If Humanity manages to achieve this, then humans will transition from a planetary species to an interstellar one.
