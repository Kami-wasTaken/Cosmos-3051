                <p id="dd">Currently, the most efficient way to produce energy is through nuclear fission. If research is successful we may use fusion reactors in the future which will cause an exponential increase in energy production.  
                </p>
                <p id="dd">But what is the next step for nuclear energy? It would be a Dyson sphere. The sun holds as much energy as trillions of nuclear bombs. If we can extract it, the galactic expansion would become viable and energy issues on Earth would cease to exist.
                </p>
                <p id="dd">A Dyson sphere is a device that would fully harness the energy of the sun. The best way to build it would be to surround the sun with quadrillion reflective satellites. But to build this many Satellites, we would have to resort to getting minerals from asteroids and other celestial bodies. We would most probably have to disassemble entire planets since the Earth won't have enough resources to even build 10% of it.
                </p>
                <p id="dd">Another complication would be, energy. If we utilize all of the energy on Earth, the most we could do is launch an entire mountain into space. To build a Dyson Sphere, we would have to set up a base on mercury as it is material rich and closest to the sun. Since the gravity there is about a 3rd of the Earth's launching satellites will also be easier. By setting up solar collectors we would be able to harness the energy to build a Dyson Sphere.
                </p>
                <p id="dd">This can only be possible if the entire earth becomes united and political conflicts are eradicated. If Humanity manages to achieve this, then humans will transition from a planetary species to an interstellar one.

                <p id="tvd">Living on mars is a topic that is quite famous between scientists and billionaires like Elon Musk. But what other options do we have to choose from? It is possible to live on Venus and not a life with domes and suits but to transform it into a habitable planet like the Earth.
                </p>
                <p id="tvd">The issue with living on Venus is that 97% of its atmosphere is filled with carbon dioxide whereas Earth's atmosphere only has 0.04% carbon dioxide. We can already feel a difference in heat on earth in itself due to global warming, so imagine how hot Venus would be. In addition to this, Venus has a much denser atmosphere which would make it hard to breathe and the pressure would be too great for our body to handle. The reason terraforming Venus would be beneficial is because Venus is almost as big as the earth and has 90% of Earth's gravity. 
                </p>
                <p id="tvd">Terraforming Venus is currently not possible, but humans in the future could do it in several thousand years. The first step would be to remove the carbon dioxide. We could do this by blocking sunlight to Venus using a mirror so that Venus would become colder. We couldn't use a regular mirror since it would just break, so we would have to use an annular mirror. An annular mirror is built up of many pieces and reflects light around the planet instead of just blocking it.
                </p>
                <p id="tvd">After we build the giant mirror, Venus would cool down over decades but be uninhabitable due to the dense atmosphere. After a few decades, the planet reaches optimum temperature, and the carbon dioxide rains down in a liquid form. There would be rainstorms for another few decades and the liquid carbon dioxide turns to lakes and oceans. Unfortunately, at this stage temperatures will reach around -50 degrees Celsius and rise causing the oceans to freeze. The pressure then falls and the atmosphere will then be around 99% nitrogen. Then we would need to shoot the frozen carbon dioxide out into space and then create water bodies for which we could get water from ice moons like Jupiter's Europa. To transport all of these we would need Skyhooks which are like giant catapults. Using these skyhooks, we can shoot nitrogen out using the same method as carbon dioxide to lower the atmospheric pressure. 
                </p>
                <p id="tvd">The last thing we need to do now is to heat Venus and transport life. We can't just remove the annular mirrors, or Venus would become too hot. Instead, we would use another set of mirrors to simulate a day and night cycle similar to Earth's and heat Venus. For the life Form, We would have to send trillions of Cyanobacteria which would perform photosynthesis and start producing Oxygen. This bacteria will also perform nitrogen fixation to create nutrients such as ammonia for living organisms. We would need to use machines to grind ocean rocks to the soil for trees and plants to grow on and further fertilize Venus.
                </p>
                <p id="tvd">After all of this, Humans could finally live and colonize a fully terraformed, Venus.

            <h1 class="amt">Asteroid Mining</h1>
            <div class="amc">
                <p id="amd">Asteroids are mineral-rich and Asteroid mining will allow humans to gain access to unlimited resources. The entire term of non-renewable resources may disappear if we do so. But Asteroid Mining comes with many problems.
                </p>
                <p id="amd">The steps for asteroid mining would be that first, we would have to select an asteroid. Then we would have to bring it closer to Earth and a safe place. Then we would extract the minerals and get them on Earth.
                </p>
                <p id="amd">The biggest issue is that Asteroid mining is highly unprofitable. The entire process would be much more expensive than the materials we extract. 
                </p>
                <p id="amd">To make asteroid mining practical, we would have to make space travel cheaper. We can do so by switching fuel-based rockets to electric ones. Since the largest portion of the cost when traveling far into space is rocket fuel. Switching to electric engines wouldn't be so hard. Since there are already satellites with electric rocket engines. 
                </p>
                <p id="amd">If we manage to reach the selected asteroid, we would need to stabilize it with lasers or thrusters. After that, the asteroid can be brought to a safe place, ready to be mined for minerals.
                </p>
                <p id="amd">The mining process would be different. Since there is no Ozone outside the Earth's atmosphere, we will be able to use mirrors and the Sun's rays to penetrate through the asteroid and mine the materials.
                </p>
                <p id="amd">f we manage to achieve asteroid mining, the start of space colonization would just be a few years away.

            <h1 class="set">Stellar Engine</h1>
            <div class = "sec">
                <p id="sed">A stellar engine is a rather ambitious project and is only to be used during a crisis. But what exactly is a Stellar engine. Objects in space are always moving usually at extreme speed. Suppose, a giant body passes the Earth, and its gravity showers Earth with meteors, or a star near goes supernova and creates a black hole that engulfs the Earth. If such a catastrophic event were to happen, we would know in advance.
                </p>
                <p id="sed">If we had to relocate the Earth to avoid such a disaster, we couldn't just move the Earth since the Earth leaving its orbit would also make it uninhabitable. Instead, we would have to move our entire solar system. Even though it sounds impossible to move an entire solar system, it can be done. Since everything in the solar system revolves around the Sun's gravity, theoretically we would only have to move the sun, to relocate the solar system.
                </p>
                <p id="sed">To do this, we would have to use a Stellar engine. A stellar engine is an engine with enough energy, to move an astronomical object. The easiest method to create a stellar engine could be possible in the future since its model is simple.
                </p>
                <p id="sed">The first one is called 'The Shkadov thruster'. The Shkadov thruster is a giant mirror. This concept works similarly to a rocket engine. In space, photons in light rays carry momentum and since there are no resistances in space, we could move slowly with just light. Since the sun produces around 10⁴⁵ photons per second, it would move much faster than if we used a flashlight. For the mirror to work, it would have to be as thin as a red blood cell, so that it can be pushed against gravity, by the sun's radiation. The shape of the mirror would also have to be a parabola so that we don't reflect the sun's light to the sun and cause it to explode. A parabola would shoot the sun's light rays in a straight direction allowing the sun to move. The last complication that needs to be considered is that the Shkadov thruster would have to be built over the poles of the sun or it could end up burning and destroying planets.
                </p>
                <p id="sed">Some disasters have already been predicted for the future by astronomers, but with a stellar engine, these disasters can be avoided. If civilization manages to build a Dyson sphere, this project would be pretty simple. Perhaps finding alien life would also become easier with this, since moving through the galaxy would also become simpler.
